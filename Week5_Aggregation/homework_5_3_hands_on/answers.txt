db.grades.aggregate( [
	{ $unwind:"$scores" },
	{ $match: {"scores.type":{$ne:"quiz"}}},
	{ $group: {_id:{sID:"$student_id",cID:"$class_id"},avg_student_score:{$avg:"$scores.score"}}},

We want to get the class ID with the highest non-quiz average score

Documents are in format:

{_id, student_id, class_id, scores [array of {type,score}]}

Idea is to 
1) unwind so we get rid of the array
2) purge out quiz scores (match anything that scores.type is not "quiz")
3) group by students_class to get average scores of students in each class
4) group by class to get average scores of classes
5) sort by average class scores
