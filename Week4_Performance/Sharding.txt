  Sharding
------------

Sometimes, you can't put ALL the data on a single server
You can shard to deploy multiple Mongo servers that each contain different data sets

Application  ->  mongoS     -> 	mongoD
		(router)	(bunch of mongo servers)

* There can be multiple mongoS routers, but usually is on same machine as application running

Each mongoD has a Replica Set (replications in case primary server goes down)



Queries usually require a shard_key (i.e. student_id)
Based on student_id, mongoS will send the query to the correct mongo server

* INSERT * requires the complete shard_key

* UPDATE * REMOVE * FIND *
	if no shard_key given, then query is broadcasted to all servers!
