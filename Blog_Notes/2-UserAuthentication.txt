3) MongoDB dtabase responds with a username to Application
4) Application responds to the first GET request with a HTML page

When loggin in...
Present a username and log-in
1) Browser sends HTTP POST request to application
2) Application checks username/password in MongoDB
3) If valid login, create an entry in sessions collection
4) Application receives session and responds to browser with following:
	- redirection to the Welcome page (with cookie)
	- Browser sends GET request to Application (see above)
	- keeping in mind the cookie information for session
